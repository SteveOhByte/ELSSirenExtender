ELSSirenExtender

This plugin was inspired by and borrows code from [Rich's](https://github.com/Rich-Dunne) [Automatic Siren Cutout](https://github.com/Rich-Dunne/Automatic-Siren-Cutout-DevRepo).

Permission was obtained directly from Rich for the creation of this plugin.

 

ELSSirenExtender is a simple plugin to provide some additional features to users of [ELS](https://www.lcpdfr.com/downloads/gta5mods/scripts/13865-emergency-lighting-system/) vehicles.

 

Please note, that to use ELSSirenExtender, you must have ELS installed.

 

Features:

Automatic Siren Cutoff! — ON by Default
If you exit an ELS vehicle while the siren is still turned on, it will automatically be turned off.
Friendly Return Honking! — ON by Default
If you honk or yelp near an AI emergency vehicle using ELS keys, they will yelp or honk back.
AI Vehicle Avoidance! — ON by Default
If you park (stationary) a vehicle with lights activated, AI traffic will curve around the vehicle.
Leave Engine Running! — OFF by Default
Simply disables the automatic engine turnoff when exiting a vehicle.
All features can be toggled on/off via the included configuration file.

F.A.Q.

   - Q: What's different between this and Rich's plugin?

      - A: Hopefully the amount of people it will work for. AutomaticSirenCutout seems to be outdated and not entirely functioning for different players (myself included, hence why I made this plugin)

   - Q: How do I edit the .lc file?

      - A: LiteConfig or .lc files are simple text files, you can edit with any text editor such as Notepad.

 

   - Q: I'm having issues with some or all of the mod's listed features, what should I do?

      - A: Please send me a direct message. If possible, include a video of what you tried in-game, as well as your RagePluginHook log file (found in your GTAV folder).
